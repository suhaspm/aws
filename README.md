🟢 1. Introduction
Hello! In this demo project, I’ll walk you through the progress made on my full-stack deployment project.
The goal was to connect a Spring Boot backend to AWS services like S3 and DynamoDB.

🏗️ 2. What I Built
I created a REST endpoint /api/create-deployment in the backend that:

Uploads a dummy file to an S3 bucket

Stores metadata (like file ID and S3 URL) in a DynamoDB table

📦 3. Code Overview
✅ Controller
Inside DeploymentController.java, I created a POST endpoint that generates a unique ID, creates a file, uploads it to S3, and saves the metadata in DynamoDB.

java
Copy
Edit
@PostMapping("/create-deployment")
public String createDeployment() {
    String bucketName = "lambda-upload-trigger-dev";
    String tableName = "FileMetadataTable";
    String deploymentId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    String key = deploymentId + ".txt";

    String s3Url = s3Service.uploadDummyFile(bucketName, key);
    dynamoDBService.saveDeploymentMetadata(tableName, deploymentId, s3Url);

    return "Deployment Created. File URL: " + s3Url;
}
✅ S3Service
Handles creating and uploading a simple text file to the specified S3 bucket using the AWS SDK.

✅ DynamoDBService
Persists metadata in DynamoDB using PutItemRequest.

🧪 4. Live Demo (Postman)
Open Postman

Send a POST request to:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://localhost:8080/api/create-deployment
Show the successful response:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Deployment Created. File URL: https://lambda-upload-trigger-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/1234-uuid.txt
✅ Verify in AWS Console:

S3: Show the uploaded file

DynamoDB: Show the matching item in the table

📝 5. Documentation and Version Control
